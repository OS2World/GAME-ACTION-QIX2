QIX for OS/2 Version 1.0, classic DOS game now for OS/2. Second release, now includes KBDVIO32.DLL. 

-----------------

QIX/2, second release!


When digging through my filebase, I stumbled upon QIX/2, a port of a classic
DOS-game, I did 4(!) years ago, when trying Speed Pascal/2 1.5.Alpha.1.

The game is still funny to play, and OS/2 people need lots of fun these days.

The source is dated from 1991 and I do not know who the author (is) was.
I don't think this is of any matter....

The first release of Qix/2, about 2 month ago, was lacking one file, which 
caused QIX2.EXE to crash immediately, i.e. the runtime-DLL of SpeedPascal/2
named KBDVIO32.DLL, which is present on my system, obviously reintroduced by
other programs. Sorry for the inconvenience! Nothing else has changed...

Many thanks go to to Rocko for pointing me on this one.

So have fun (at last).

--------
QIX for OS/2 32bit Version 1.0

Finally!!!

After years of waiting for this ultimate classic DOS-game, now there 
is a port to OS/2. And not only a port, there are also some enhancements:

*  Coloured Greeblys, coloured Qix and coloured Me!!
*  Coloured score, lives, percentage!!
*  Coloured line telling you, that it's the OS/2-Version that is runnimg.
*  And it's 32bit, therefore it is fast, as fast as the original 
   Version was expected to be (on an XT)
*  /Q disables all sounds.
   
Oh, yes, you would not believe it! Now, as long as other games are not 
released for OS/2, we can play good, old Qix. At last.

Warning: If you take all this seriously, there is probably something 
         wrong with you!

History: 0.9 15-08-95 First release. QixStat is here, but not yet enabled.
         1.0 14-09-95 Complete. Stat-Files are incompatible to those of the 
                      DOS-Version.
             
If something goes wrong, blame it on the compiler. The port was done with 
the great Speed-Pascal/2 1.5.ALPHA-1 from Rene Nuernberger, who can be

The compiler is really great. The port was done in a jiffy. And its 
a probably 10 year old code, which was ported from MV-Pascal to 
Turbo Pascal 3 and 4. I do not know who the author is (was).

I had to replace some DOS-Calls which were done via Interrupt and a keyboard 
routine. What is more I had to change the Format of the Stats-File, because
the code the compiler produced from the old Source did not run. 

BTW. I am not a programmer.

Keep on WARPing!!
